# Movie Browser App - Technical Documentation

## Problem Understanding
The task was to create a mobile application that allows users to browse and interact with movie data. Key requirements included:
- Implementing a movie browsing interface with multiple categories
- Creating a robust search functionality
- Enabling movie favoriting with local persistence
- Ensuring smooth performance with lazy loading
- Implementing a responsive and intuitive UI

## Architecture & Tech Stack

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Native (Expo)**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience
- **React Navigation**: For handling navigation between screens
- **React Native Paper**: For Material Design components
- **AsyncStorage**: For local data persistence
- **Axios**: For API communication

### State Management
- Local React state for UI components
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Context API for theme management

### Data Flow
1. API Layer (`services/api.ts`)
2. Custom Hooks (`hooks/`)
3. Screen Components (`screens/`)
4. UI Components (`components/`)

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic Structure
- Set up React Native with Expo
- Implemented TypeScript configuration
- Created basic project structure
- Set up navigation system

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implemented movie listing with TMDB API
- Added search functionality with debounce
- Created detailed movie view
- Implemented favorites system

### Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancement
- Added dark mode support
- Implemented smooth animations
- Enhanced error handling
- Added loading states
- Improved performance

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
- Manual testing of all features
- Performance optimization
- Bug fixes and improvements

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Theme Implementation**
   - Challenge: System theme detection and smooth transitions
   - Solution: Used React Native's Appearance API and Animated API for smooth transitions

2. **Search Performance**
   - Challenge: Frequent API calls during search
   - Solution: Implemented debouncing with lodash

3. **Local Storage**
   - Challenge: Managing favorites state across app restarts
   - Solution: Used AsyncStorage with proper error handling

4. **Performance**
   - Challenge: Large lists causing performance issues
   - Solution: Implemented proper list virtualization with FlatList

## Learnings

1. **Technical Skills**
   - Deep understanding of React Native's performance optimization
   - Better grasp of TypeScript in React Native context
   - Experience with Material Design implementation

2. **Best Practices**
   - Importance of proper error handling
   - Value of type safety in large applications
   - Significance of code organization

3. **Project Management**
   - Importance of breaking down features into manageable tasks
   - Value of systematic testing
   - Significance of documentation

## Future Improvements
1. Add unit tests
2. Implement caching for offline support
3. Add more movie categories
4. Enhance search with filters
5. Add user authentication
